= jdp-2023-08: Use Catalog as Package

== Status

* Draft
* Proposed for: Jaybird 6

== Type

* Feature-Specification

== Context

Firebird 3.0 introduced packages as a way to group stored procedures and stored functions in a single module.

The JDBC specification -- and by extension Jaybird -- provides no support to access metadata information on stored procedures and stored functions in packages.

`DatabaseMetaData` methods `getFunctions`, `getFunctionColumns`, `getProducedures` and `getProcedureColumns` do offer two parameters which are unused by Jaybird: `catalog` and `schemaNamePattern`.
In JDBC methods, a parameter value `null` means "`[catalog/schema] name should not be used to narrow the search`", while `""` (empty string) means "`return those without [catalog/schema]`".

According to the SQL standard, catalogs are:

[quote,ISO/IEC 9075-1:2003]
____
A _catalog_ is a named collection of SQL-schemas, foreign server descriptors, and foreign data wrapper descriptors in an SQL-environment.
____

Which in our interpretation refers to an individual database.
In Firebird, databases are isolated and unknown to each other, and it is not possible to directly query another database.
We don't expect this state of affairs to change any time soon.

Schemas are:

[quote,ISO/IEC 9075-1:2003]
____
An _SQL-schema_, often referred to simply as a schema, is a persistent, named collection of descriptors.
____

Firebird currently doesn't have schemas.
Although the definition of schema is closer to that of a package (it is a named collection of procedure and function descriptors), we expect that _if_ schemas are implemented in Firebird, packages are likely contained in schemas.

The Oracle JDBC driver also uses the `catalog` parameter of metadata methods to refine searches to a packages (see https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjdbc/JDBC-reference-information.html#GUID-07453AC2-CFF8-42FA-8107-FE2AACF6AEF9[this note^]).

== Decision

Jaybird will introduce a Boolean connection property `useCatalogAsPackage`.
When this property is enabled, Jaybird will accept the `catalog` parameter in `DatabaseMetaData` to return information in procedures and functions in packages.

=== Rejected alternatives

The following options were considered and rejected:

* Enable by default, and always report information on packages in catalog columns.
+
We're not sure how standard JDBC tools will handle this, so we prefer a conservative approach and require opt-in.
+
This may be changed in the future
* Use schema instead of catalog.
+
As mentioned earlier, we think it is more likely that Firebird will introduce _schema_ than discoverability of other databases and cross-database query capability (i.e. _catalog_).

== Consequences

When `useCatalogAsPackage` is enabled, `DatabaseMetaData` will exhibit the following behaviour:

* `getCatalogs()` lists packages, with package names in `TABLE_CAT`.
* `getFunctions`, `getFunctionColumns`, `getProcedures`, and `getProcedureColumns` include information on procedures and functions in packages
** Normal (non-packaged) procedures and functions report their catalog as empty string instead of `null` (because of the following rule)
** If `catalog` is ``""`` (empty string), only normal stored procedures and stored functions are reported.
** If `catalog` is `null`, both packaged and normal stored procedures and stored functions are reported.
** If `catalog` is not `null` and not an empty string, these metadata methods will only return procedures, functions, or their columns of the specified package (exact match, case-sensitive, not a `LIKE` pattern)
* `getCatalogSeparator()` returns `"."` (string with period).
* `getCatalogTerm` returns `"PACKAGE"`.
* `isCatalogAtStart()` returns `true`.
* `getMaxCatalogNameLength()` returns 31 or 63 depending on the max identifier length of the database.
* `supportsCatalogsInDataManipulation()` returns `true` (i.e. access selectable stored procedures and functions).
* `supportsCatalogsInProcedureCalls()` returns `true`.
* The other `supportsCatalogsIn__type__()` methods continue to return `false`.
* Other metadata methods with a `catalog` parameter continue to ignore it, just like they do when `useCatalogAsPackage` is disabled.

The `useCatalogAsPackage` connection property does not result in any other behaviour.
