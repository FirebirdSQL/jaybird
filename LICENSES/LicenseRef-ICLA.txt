The Individual Contributor License Agreement (devdoc/jaybird-icla.txt) is
derived from the Apache ICLA (https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).

The Apache Software Foundation does not seem to specify a license for their
licenses, however their Licensing FAQ states under "May I re-use (and modify)
the ASF Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) for my own purposes?" (see
https://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html#CLA-Usage):

""""
Yes, you can re-use and modify them; You just can't hold the ASF legally
responsible if these documents are not exactly what you intend them to be. We
recommend that you obtain your own legal advice so you know exactly what you are
getting yourself into.

If you adapt these agreements for your own purposes, make sure that the phrase
'Apache Software Foundation' and any confusingly similar references or parts
that specifically refer to the Apache organisation do not appear in your version
of the agreements (except to note that your version is derived and differs from
the original provided by the ASF).
""""

In other words, attribution is required, but beyond that, there doesn't seem to
be an explicit license.
