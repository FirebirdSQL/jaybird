Reporting Bugs
==============

The developers follow the firebird-java@googlegroups.com list. Join the list and
post information about suspected bugs. List members may be able to help out to
determine if it is an actual bug, provide a workaround and get you going again,
whereas bug fixes might take a while.

You can report bugs in the Firebird bug tracker, 
<https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/jaybird/issues/>.

When reporting bugs, please provide a minimal, but complete reproduction,
including databases and sourcecode to reproduce the problem. Patches to fix bugs
are also appreciated. Make sure the patch is against a recent master version of
the code. You can also fork the jaybird repository and create pull requests.
