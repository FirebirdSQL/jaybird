Contributing
============

There are several ways you can contribute to Jaybird or Firebird in general:

* Participate on the mailing lists (see <https://www.firebirdsql.org/en/mailing-lists/>)
* Report bugs or submit patches on the tracker (see below)
* Create pull requests on GitHub (<https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/jaybird>)
* Become a developer (for Jaybird contact us on firebird-java, for Firebird in
  general, use the Firebird-devel mailing list)
* Donate to the Firebird Foundation (see <https://www.firebirdsql.org/en/donate/>)
* Become a paying member or sponsor of the Firebird Foundation (see
  <http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/firebird-foundation/>

Reporting Bugs
==============

The developers follow the firebird-java@yahoogroups.com list. Join the list and
post information about suspected bugs. List members may be able to help out to
determine if it is an actual bug, provide a workaround and get you going again,
whereas bug fixes might take awhile.

You can report bugs in the Firebird bug tracker, project
["Java Client (Jaybird)"](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC)

When reporting bugs, please provide a minimal, but complete reproduction,
including databases and sourcecode to reproduce the problem. Patches to fix bugs
are also appreciated. Make sure the patch is against a recent master version of
the code. You can also fork the jaybird repository and create pull requests.
