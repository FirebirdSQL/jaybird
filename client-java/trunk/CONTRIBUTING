Reporting Bugs and submitting patches
=====================================
The developers follow the Firebird-Java@yahoogroups.com list. Join the list and
post information about suspected bugs. List members may be able to help out to
determine if it is an actual bug, provide a workaround and get you going again, 
whereas bug fixes might take awhile.

If you are sure that you have found a bug you can report it in the Firebird bug 
tracker, project "Java Client (Jaybird)" at 
http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC

When reporting bugs, please provide a minimal, but complete reproduction, 
including databases and sourcecode to reproduce the problem. Patches to fix bugs
are also appreciated. Make sure the patch is against a recent trunk version of
the code.
