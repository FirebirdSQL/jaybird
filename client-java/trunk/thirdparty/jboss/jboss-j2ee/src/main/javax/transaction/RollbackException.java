 *  The RollbackException exception indicates that either the transaction

 *  <ul>
 *    <li>
 *    At transaction commit time, if the transaction has been marked for
 *    rollback only. In this case, the <code>commit</code> method will roll
 *    back the transaction and throw this exception to indicate that the

 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 *    At other times, if an operation cannot be completed because the

 *    The {@link Transaction#enlistResource(javax.transaction.xa.XAResource) enlistResource}
