# This translation file provides a mapping between some characters from the
# ISO Latin-1 character set that are incorrectly handled by the HP-UX platform
#
# Format of the file is a mapping of the characters that come from database into
# characters that should be returned to the Java application. The mapping is
# symmetric and its inversion is used to map characters that come from the
# application into the characters that are written in the database
# 
# Each property in this file must start with "db.", a marker that tells Jaybird
# that next character is the character that comes from database. After this
# prefix comes single Unicode character, then separator (whitespace, colon or
# equal sign '='), then single Unicode character that should be returned to 
# Java application instead of the previously mentioned one. Unicode character
# should be specified as \u followed by the 4-digit hex code of the character
#


# Ä - capital A with diaeresis
db.\u00d8=\u00c4

# ä - small a with diaeresis
db.\u00cc=\u00e4

# Ö - capital O with diaeresis
