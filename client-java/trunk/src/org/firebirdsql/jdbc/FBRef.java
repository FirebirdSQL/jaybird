/**
 * The mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL <code>REF</code>
 * value, which is a reference to an
 * SQL structured type value in the database.
 * <P>
 * SQL <code>REF</code> values are stored in a special table that contains
 * instances of a referenceable SQL structured type, and each <code>REF</code>
 * value is a unique identifier for one instance in that table. 
 * An SQL <code>REF</code> value may be used in place of the
 * SQL structured type it references; it may be used as either a column value in a
 * table or an attribute value in a structured type.
 * <P>
 * Because an SQL <code>REF</code> value is a logical pointer to an
 * SQL structured type, a <code>Ref</code> object is by default also a logical
 * pointer; thus, retrieving an SQL <code>REF</code> value as
 * a <code>Ref</code> object does not materialize
 * the attributes of the structured type on the client.
 * <P>
 * A <code>Ref</code> object can be saved to persistent storage and is dereferenced by
 * passing it as a parameter to an SQL statement and executing the 
 * statement.
 * <P>
 * The <code>Ref</code> interface is new in the JDBC 2.0 API.
