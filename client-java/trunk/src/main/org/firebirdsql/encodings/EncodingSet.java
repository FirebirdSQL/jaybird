/**
 * <code>EncodingSet</code> is an interface for the purpose of loading {@link EncodingDefinition} mappings into
 * Jaybird.
 * <p>
 * Jaybird uses the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} mechanism to load the EncodingSet. An implementation must
 * provide a no-arg constructor, and it must be listed in <code>META-INF/services/org.firebirdsql.encodings.EncodingSet</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Providing an EncodingSet in general is not necessary, as Jaybird provides a default. However if Jaybird does not
 * include
 * an encoding, or the current mapping from Firebird to Java (or reverse) doesn't match your requirements, then you
 * can use this mechanism to override it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The encoding information is only loaded once, so the definition will need to be available in the classpath of the
 * class loader that initially loads and initializes Jaybird.
