   JDK 1.1 beta3 or JDK 1.0.2 with JDBC 1.2

Added metadata table column name tests

Added in/out parameter tests

Enhanced testing of null parameter values

Converted tests for JDBC 1.2 (BigDecimal)

Fixed several database compatibility problems in existing tests



Version .05 Notes
-----------------
Added connection tests RetainedResultSet RetainedStatement
Deleted connection test DisableAutoClose
Fixed bugs in the dbmetadata Keys test
Revised tests to use java.lang.Bignum in place of java.sql.Numeric

What is the JDBC Test Suite?
-----------------------------
The JDBC Test Suite is a set of java classes that each extend
jdbcTest.harness.TestModule class. These tests can only be run by the
JDBC Test Harness. The tests are divided into packages - one for each
JDBC interface being tested.

Over time the test suite will grow into its intended role as a JDBC
driver certification mechanism. Currently, it is a useful mechanism for
examining the functionality provided by a JDBC driver.

The Test Suite is written entirely in Java.

The Test Suite was jointly developed by JavaSoft and Intersolv.


Who to contact?
---------------
You can contact us at jdbc@wombat.eng.sun.com


What version of JDBC is supported?
----------------------------------
The Test Suite supports JDBC version 1.1.


What operating systems are supported?
-------------------------------------
The Test Suite can be run on any system that supports Java. It was
developed with JDK 1.0.2.


Installation
------------
You must have already installed Java, JDBC and a JDBC driver. You will
also need the JDBC Test Harness.

See the Java web page for info on installing the JDK and JDBC.

You must have access to a database and permission to create tables and
database procedures.

The Test Suite will install itself in the jdbc-tests directory; be sure to
add the jdbc-tests/classes directory to your Java CLASSPATH environment
variable.

Both a compressed tar file for Unix and a zip file for Windows is
provided. Be sure to use a version of unzip that preserves long file
names.

For Solaris uncompress and extract (tar xvf) the files.


Using the Test Suite
--------------------
See the JDBC Test Harness release notes.


Resource ini Files
------------------
Some of the tests rely on existing objects in the database. The objects
are loaded and removed using SQL statements provided in resource files.
The test suite provides versions of these files for Oracle, SQLServer
and Sybase.

If you are using a different database you will likely have to create
translated version of these. The harness allows you to set the resource
directory for a test run.

Each file is named for its corresponding test. For instance, the
jdbcTest.data.CreateTables test has an ini file named
jdbcTest.data.CreateTables.ini


Writing Your Own Tests
----------------------
You can write your own JDBC tests. See the jdbc-tests/jdbcTest/examples
directory for several runnable example tests.

If you have tests you would like to donate to us please send them to
jdbc@wombat.eng.sun.com.



Debugging
---------
Most test failures should be clear from the logging provided by the
test itself. In the cases where this is insufficient, you can enable
DriverManager tracing in JDBCTestWin.ini with:

[Driver Options]
;Set this to ON if you want full JDBC DriverManager tracing enabled.
DriverManagerLog = ON

When DriverManager tracing is enabled all JDBC drivers should show a
detailed trace of their activities. This will be interspersed with the
logging done by the test itself.


Known Bugs
----------
There are no known test bugs; however, different drivers and DBMS's are
bound to find problems. We would like to know about any problems you
encounter. Please send a DriverManager test log with each report.

If you have suggestions for improving the Test Suite let us know.
