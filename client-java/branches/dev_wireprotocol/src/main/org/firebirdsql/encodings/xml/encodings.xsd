                                            Fully qualified name of a class implementing org.firebirdsql.encodings.EncodingDefinition to provide custom encoding/decoding. This class must

                                            If set to true, this encoding will only be mapped by its Firebird encoding name. This is for example used to map Firebird encoding
                                            UNICODE-FSS to Java encoding UTF-8, but in reverse Java encoding UTF-8 is mapped to Firebird encoding UTF8. Defaults to false.
