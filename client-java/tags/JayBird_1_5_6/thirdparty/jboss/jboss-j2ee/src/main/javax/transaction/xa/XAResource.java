/**
 *  The XAResource interface is a Java mapping of the industry standard XA
 *  interface based on the X/Open CAE Specification (Distributed Transaction
 *  Processing: The XA Specification). 
 *  <p>
 *  The XA interface defines the contract between a Resource Manager and a
 *  Transaction Manager in a distributed transaction processing (DTP)
 *  environment.
 *  An XA resource such as a JDBC driver or a JMS provider implements this
 *  interface to support association between a global transaction and a
 *  database or message service connection. 
 *  <p>
 *  The XAResource interface can be supported by any transactional resource
 *  that is intended to be used by application programs in an environment
 *  where transactions are controlled by an external transaction manager.
 *  An example of such a resource is a database management system.
 *  An application may access data through multiple database connections.
 *  Each database connection is enlisted with the transaction manager as a
 *  transactional resource. The transaction manager obtains an XAResource for
 *  each connection participating in a global transaction. The transaction
 *  manager uses the {@link #start(Xid, int) start} method to associate the
 *  global transaction with the resource, and it uses the
 *  {@link #end(Xid, int) end} method to disassociate the transaction from
 *  the resource.
 *  The resource manager is responsible for associating the global
 *  transaction to all work performed on its data between the start and
 *  end method invocation. 
 *  <p>
 *  At transaction commit time, the resource managers are informed by the
 *  transaction manager to prepare, commit, or rollback a transaction
 *  according to the two-phase commit protocol.
 *  <p>
 *  Behind the resources that implement this interface the resource manager
 *  exists. The resource manager does not have a public interface or direct
 *  references, and can manage several resources.
 *  To see if two resources are managed by the same resource manager, the
 *  {@link #isSameRM(XAResource)} method can be used.
