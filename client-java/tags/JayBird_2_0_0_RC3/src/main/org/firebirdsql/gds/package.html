	This package contains classes defining Firebird API for Java language
	that applications can use to access databases directly without JDBC 
	interfaces. This is probably most efficient way to access the database, 
	however also it is the most complicated one and requires deep knowledge
	of the Firebird API. For better understanding please refer to the 
	"InterBase 6 API Guide" published by Borland and released together with
	the open-sourcing the InterBase code, a predecessor of Firebird.

	<p>
	All database related operations are performed by an instance of the
	<a href="GDS.html"><code>org.firebirdsql.gds.GDS</code></a> interface,
	which simultaneously acts as a factory for all needed data structures.
	</p>
	<p>
	Each database operation defined in the <a href="GDS.html"><code>org.firebirdsql.gds.GDS</code></a>
	interface throws an instance of <a href="GDSException.html"><code>org.firebirdsql.gds.GDSException</code></a>
	if database server returned an error for that operation. All constants needed
	by those operations are defined in a <a href="ISCConstants.html"><code>org.firebirdsql.gds.ISCConstants</code></a>
	class and are duplicated in corresponding data structures.

	<p>
	Please refer to the documentation in the javadoc comments as well as 
	to the source code for more information.
