firebird-html theme
===================

This theme is a manual modification of the standard Asciidoctor theme (<https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/asciidoctor/asciidoctor@2.0/data/stylesheets/asciidoctor-default.css>). See also [Customize the default stylesheet](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/html-backend/default-stylesheet/#customize-the-default-stylesheet).

Specifically, it includes: 

- different colors (headings and code blocks)
- some margin changes
- some tweaks to layout/rendering of some elements
- extra h7 element (same styling as h6)
- styles for tocbot (which replaces the default table of contents)

Updating it requires downloading the Asciidoctor default stylesheet and careful diffing (and deciding which changes need to be preserved or not).
