General Notes
=============

Jaybird is a JCA/JDBC driver suite to connect to Firebird database servers.

This driver is based on both the JCA standard for application server connections
to enterprise information systems and the well-known JDBC standard.

The JCA standard specifies an architecture in which an application server can
cooperate with a driver so that the application server manages transactions,
security, and resource pooling, and the driver supplies only the connection
functionality. While similar to the JDBC `XADataSource` concept, the JCA
specification is considerably clearer on the division of responsibility between
the application server and driver.

Supported Firebird versions
---------------------------

Jaybird @VERSION@ was tested against Firebird 2.5.7, and 
Firebird 3.0.2, but should also support other Firebird versions from
1.0 and up. The Type 2 and embedded server JDBC drivers require the appropriate
JNI library. Precompiled JNI binaries for Windows and Linux platforms are 
shipped in the default installation, other platforms require porting/building 
the JNI library for that platform.

Connecting to Firebird 3 requires some additional configuration, see
[Jaybird and Firebird 3.0](https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/jaybird/wiki/Jaybird-and-Firebird-3)
for details.

Firebird 4 is not formally supported in Jaybird 2.2.x, although connecting and 
most functionality will work. We suggest that you use Jaybird 3.x or higher for 
Firebird 4. Support for newer data types like `DECFLOAT` and `NUMERIC`/`DECIMAL` 
with precision higher than 18 will be introduced in Jaybird 4. 

This driver does not support InterBase servers due to Firebird-specific changes
in the protocol and database attachment parameters.

Supported Java versions
-----------------------

Jaybird @VERSION@ supports Java 6 (JDBC 4.0), Java 7 (JDBC 4.1) and Java 8 
(JDBC 4.2). Support for earlier Java versions has been dropped.

The upcoming Jaybird 3.0 will support Java 7, 8, and 9.

Specification support
---------------------

Jaybird @VERSION@ supports the following specifications:

|Specification|Notes
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------
| JDBC 4.2    | Driver does not fully support JDBC 4.2 features, but implements large update count methods by calling the normal update count methods, and methods with `SQLType` by calling methods accepting the `java.sql.Types` integer value. Supports new `java.Time` classes with some caveats.
| JDBC 4.1    | Driver implements all JDBC 4.1 methods added to existing interfaces. The driver explicitly supports `closeOnCompletion`, most other methods introduced with JDBC 4.1 throw `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`.
| JDBC 4.0    | Driver implements all JDBC 4.0 interfaces and supports exception chaining.
| JCA 1.0     | Jaybird provides implementation of `javax.resource.spi.ManagedConnectionFactory` and related interfaces. CCI interfaces are not supported. Although Jaybird depends on the JCA 1.5 classes, JCA 1.5 compatibility is currently not guaranteed.
| JTA 1.0.1   | Driver provides an implementation of `javax.transaction.xa.XAResource` interface via JCA framework and `XADataSource` implementation.
| JMX 1.2     | Jaybird provides a MBean to manage Firebird servers and installed databases via JMX agent.

What's new in Jaybird 2.2
==========================

Changelog
---------

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.15

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.15:

-   Fixed: Exceptions during fetch of cached result sets (holdable over commit, scrollable and 
    metadata) prevented prepared statement reuse/re-execute with error _"Attempt to reopen an open 
    cursor"_ ([JDBC-531](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-531))
-   Fixed: Jaybird cannot parse Firebird version numbers with revisions ([JDBC-534](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-534))
-   Fixed: Incorrect parsing of Firebird version numbers ([JDBC-535](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-535))

**Known issues in Jaybird 2.2.15**

-   Connecting to Firebird 2.5 and earlier with a Firebird 3 `fbclient.dll` may
    be slow with native connections, see [CORE-4658](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/CORE-4658).
    Workaround is to connect to the IPv4 address instead of the hostname, or to
    use a Firebird 2.5 or earlier `fbclient.dll`.

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.14

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.14:

-   Fixed: FBTraceManager.loadConfigurationFromFile strips line breaks ([JDBC-493](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-493))
-   Improved: Added explicit `Automatic-Module-Name: org.firebirdsql.jaybird` to 
    manifest for forwards compatibility with Java 9 modularization. ([JDBC-511](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-511))

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.13

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.13:

-   Improved: Support for Firebird 4 object name length of 63 characters ([JDBC-467](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-467))
-   Various improvements to thread safety and incomplete object validity checks.
    ([JDBC-469](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-469))
    ([JDBC-470](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-470))    
    Some methods did not throw an `SQLException` when the object (`ResultSet`, 
    `Statement`, `Connection`) was already closed. This sometimes lead to an
    unclear `RuntimeException` at a later point. In other cases an `SQLException`
    was thrown, even though the object was valid.
-   Fixed: Generated keys query for table with space character (or any other 
    character below `\u00A0` that was not `a`-`z`, `A`-`Z`, `0`-`9`, `$`, `_`,
    or `:`) in its (quoted) name returns empty generated keys result set ([JDBC-481](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-481))

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.12

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.12:

-   Fixed: `ResultSetMetaData` reports precision `0` for computed columns in 
    Firebird 2.5 and earlier ([JDBC-450](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-450))\
    If Firebird reports precision `0`, Jaybird will now estimate it to be 
    precision 19 (not 18). This will be improved in Jaybird 3 to report 18.
-   Calling `addBatch()` or `executeBatch()` on a statement prepared with one of
    the generated keys options will now throw an `FBDriverNotCapableException`,
    instead of an unclear `BatchUpdateException` on `executeBatch`. ([JDBC-451](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-451))\
    Support for batch execution on a prepared statement with `getGeneratedKeys` 
    support will be added in Jaybird 3.0 (see [JDBC-452](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-452)).
-   Fixed: `ResultSet.absolute(0)` should not throw an exception, but position
    the result set before the first row ([JDBC-453](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-453))
-   Fixed: `ResultSetMetaData.getPrecision` of a numeric column when no 
    transaction is active throws an SQLException ([JDBC-464](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-464))\
    As part of this fix, the handling of queries executed by `FBDatabaseMetaData` 
    has been changed. Most metadata queries are now kept prepared for reuse.

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.11

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.11:

-   Fixed: Dialect 1, `NUMERIC(15,2)` and `DatabaseMetadata.getColumn` returns
    `0` for `DECIMAL_DIGITS` ([JDBC-426](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-426))
-   Updated error messages from latest Firebird 3 to add missing messages 
    ([JDBC-428](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-428))
-   Fixed: `ResultSet.getObject()` returns `byte[]` instead of `String` for
    `BLOB SUB_TYPE 1` when using `octetsAsBytes` ([JDBC-431](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-431))
-   Improvement: Support Firebird 3 48-bit transaction ids. ([JDBC-432](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-432))\
    Note that `FBMaintenanceManager.commit/rollbackTransaction(long)` with
    longer than 32 bit transaction ids requires Firebird 3.0.1 because of
    [CORE-5224](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/CORE-5224).
-   Fixed: Batch insert with `setBinaryStream` inserts an empty `BLOB SUB_TYPE TEXT`
    ([JDBC-433](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-433))\
    This is the same issue as JDBC-312 that was fixed in Jaybird 2.2.4 for 
    `BLOB SUB_TYPE BINARY`.
-   Changed locking to coarser blocks with - as far as possible - a single lock
    object per connection for all connection-derived objects ([JDBC-435](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-435))\
    This should prevent deadlocks on concurrent access as in some cases locks
    were obtained in different orders (eg (statement, connection), and
    (connection, statement)). The downside is reduced concurrency, but as using
    a connection from multiple threads concurrently is discouraged anyway, that
    is an acceptable price to pay.

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.10

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.10:

-   Improvement: Transmit encrypted password (`isc_dpb_password_enc`
    and `isc_spb_password_enc`) in pure java protocol ([JDBC-406](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-406))\
    With this change the password is hashed using the UnixCrypt hash. Be aware
    that this does not really improve security: it only hides the password, but
    an attacker can still use this hash to gain access to Firebird.
-   Improvement: Specify `isc_tpb_lock_timeout` in transaction mapping ([JDBC-407](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-407))\
    This change was already in Jaybird 2.2.9, but not documented. This
    improvement was contributed by [Vjacheslav Borisov](https://github.com/slavb18)
-   Fixed: `DatabaseMetaData.supportsGetGeneratedKeys` does not report real
    availability of generated keys feature ([JDBC-412](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-412))\
    `DatabaseMetaData.supportsGetGeneratedKeys` will now only report `true` when
    the statement parser has been loaded (antlr-runtime is on the classpath) and
    the connected Firebird version supports `INSERT .. RETURNING ..`.
-   Fixed: `FBCachedClob` throws `SQLException` instead
    of `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` ([JDBC-414](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-414))\
    Some of the optional methods of `Clob` (especially length related) in
    `FBCachedClob` threw `FBSQLException` which prevents Hibernate from
    functioning correctly (for example in `org.hibernate.type.descriptor.java.DataHelper#determineLengthForBufferSizing`).
    These methods now throw `FBDriverNotCapableException` (which is a subclass
    of `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`).
-   Fixed: Transaction mapping cannot be configured through JDBC URL ([JDBC-421](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-421))
-   Fixed: `FBSQLWarning.getMessage()` could return `null` instead of message ([JDBC-423](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-423))

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.9

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.9:

-   Fixed: Result set of type `CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT` isn't correctly closed
    on commit ([JDBC-307](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-307))\
    At commit the client side cursor is correctly closed; no explicit close is
    sent to the server as the commit will take care of this. This change may
    result in performance degradation if you use a lot of blobs as those are now
    properly closed again, we will address this in [JDBC-401](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-401) 
    for Jaybird 3.0.
-   Fixed: Open (output) blob in auto-commit prevents connection close. Fixed by
    fixing *JDBC-307*, see above. ([JDBC-348](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-348)) 
-   New feature (experimental): Use `isc_tpb_autocommit` in auto commit mode 
    ([JDBC-399](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-399))\
    This option is enabled with the connection property `useFirebirdAutocommit`,
    see [Use `isc_tpb_autocommit` in auto commit mode (experimental)] for
    further details. Idea and initial implementation provided by [Smyatkin-Maxim](https://github.com/Smyatkin-Maxim).
-   Fixed: "*Exception. couldn't close blob: org.firebirdsql.gds.GDSException:
    invalid BLOB handle*" on close of connection obtained from DBCP data source.
    Fixed by fixing *JDBC-307*, see above. ([JDBC-400](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-400))
-   Fixed: `CallableStatement.getMetaData()` and `getParameterMetaData()` call
    throws exception when no input parameters provided when out parameter
    registered ([JDBC-402](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-402))\
    This changes the error reported when attempting to get metadata of a
    stored procedure without registering all out parameters. For retrieval of
    (parameter) metadata it will prepare the statement (potentially with too
    many parameter placeholders) and leaves error handling to the server.
-   Change: `ResultSetMetaData` will now report `(VAR)CHAR CHARACTER SET OCTETS`
    columns as `Types.BINARY` or `Types.VARBINARY` when using 
    `octetsAsBytes=true` connection property. ([JDBC-408](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-408))

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.8

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.8:

-   Support for Java 5 has been dropped
-   Fixed: LibreOffice doesn't display tables with more than 41 records
    ([JDBC-383](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-383))
-   Improvement: Don't use Firebird provided IP address for connecting
    event channel ([JDBC-384](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-384))
-   Fixed: `Connection.getMetaData().getColumns` result set contains
    wrong (empty) `COLUMN_DEF` if column type was defined using domain
    ([JDBC-388](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-388))
-   Fixed: Unable to retrieve update count after result set
    ([JDBC-390](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-390))\
    After executing a query that produces a result set, calling
    `getMoreResults` will allow `getUpdateCount` to actually return the
    update count where previously it always returned `-1`. This also
    allows obtaining the update count after a select query (even when
    executed using `executeQuery`). For selects the result will usually
    be `0`.
-   Fixed: `SELECT` statements are processed for `getGeneratedKeys` by
    appending `RETURNING` (+ all columnnames)
    ([JDBC-391](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-391))
-   Fixed: Generated key grammar does not correctly handle quoted table
    names ([JDBC-392](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-392))
-   Fixed: Generated key grammar does not detect returning clause in
    update and delete
    ([JDBC-393](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-393))

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.7

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.7:

-   Fixed: blob return value of executable procedure obtained through getters on
    `CallableStatement` is 8 byte blob id, instead of expected blob content
    ([JDBC-381](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-381))\
    This was a regression caused by the changes of
    [JDBC-350](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-350).

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.6

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.6:

-   Reverted Firebird 3 workaround for updatable result sets as bug has
    been fixed in Firebird ([JDBC-330](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-330))
-   Fixed: Processing and closing the `ResultSet` from callable
    statement and then using the getters throws `NullPointerException`
    ([JDBC-350](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-350))\
    Using both the getters and the result set for the same callable statement
    is incorrect; the ability to do this might be removed in a future
    version of Jaybird. A `ResultSet` should be used for selectable
    procedures, while the getters should be used with executable procedures.
-   Fixed: `FBManagedConnectionFactory.tryCompleteInLimboTransaction`
    doesn't work with recent Firebird 3 builds
    ([JDBC-353](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-353))
-   Fixed: Jaybird can throw a `NullPointerException` when a fatal
    connection error has occurred
    ([JDBC-359](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-359))
-   Fixed: Calling close on a JCA connection triggers exception
    *Connection enlisted in distributed transaction*
    ([JDBC-362](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-362))
-   Fixed: Potential memory-leak when using a lot of different
    connection strings and/or properties
    ([JDBC-364](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-364))
-   Fixed: `FBRowUpdater.buildInsertStatement` doesn't quote column
    names ([JDBC-370](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-370))
-   Fixed: `EncodingFactory` doesn't handle `UnsupportedCharsetException`
    ([JDBC-371](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-371))
-   Fixed: Current method of quoting in `FBRowUpdater` incorrect for
    dialect 1 ([JDBC-372](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-372))

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.5

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.5:

-   Fixed: `getCrossReference` broken by changes of
    [JDBC-331](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-331)
    ([JDBC-335](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-335))
-   Added: basic support for Java 8 `java.time` in
    `PreparedStatement.setObject()` and `ResultSet.updateObject()`
    ([JDBC-339](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-339))\
    As part of this change the supported sub-second precision for
    `java.sql.Timestamp` has been increased from 1 millisecond to the
    maximum Firebird precision of 100 microseconds (or 0.1 millisecond)[^1].
-   Fixed: Deadlocks and other thread safety issues with classes in
    `org.firebirdsql.pool` ([JDBC-341](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-341))

[^1]: With `java.sql.Timestamp` the 100 microsecond precision is only
    available through `getNanos()` and `setNanos()`

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.4

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.4:

-   Fixed: Exceptions during statement preparation leave connection and
    transaction open after explicit close
    ([JDBC-311](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-311))
-   Fixed batch update (or insert) with blob set through
    `setBinaryStream()` sets empty blob for all but the first batch
    entry ([JDBC-312](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-312))
-   Fixed incomplete checks of database, transaction, statement and blob
    handle validity before continuing with actions. These incomplete
    checks could lead to unexpected exceptions (for example a
    `NullPointerException` in `iscDatabaseInfo`)
    ([JDBC-](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-313)[313](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-313))
-   Fixed error when setting connection charset equal to
    "`file.encoding`" java property
    ([JDBC-314](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-314))
-   Fixed connection character set not correctly set when specifying the
    Java connection characterset (`charSet` or `localEncoding` property)
    ([JDBC-315](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-315))
-   Fixed incorrect lengths and/or radix reported by `getTypeInfo` and
    `getColumns` metadata
    ([JDBC-317](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-317),
    [JDBC-318](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-318))
-   Initial Java 8 / JDBC 4.2 support
    ([JDBC-319](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-319))
-   Firebird 3 `BOOLEAN` type support, see [Support for Firebird 3
    `BOOLEAN` type]
    ([JDBC-321](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-321))
-   Added fallback of loading `GDSFactoryPlugin` implementations to
    prevent `NullPointerException` in Hibernate reverse engineering
    wizard in NetBeans
    ([JDBC-325](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-325))
-   Fixed: Jaybird should specify dialect 3 in dpb when no explicit
    dialect was set
    ([JDBC-327](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-327))
-   Fixed: several `DatabaseMetaData` methods defined by JDBC to only
    accept the actual table name also accepted a `LIKE`-pattern or empty
    string or `null`. This was changed to conform to JDBC. This change
    can break applications that relied on the incorrect behavior
    ([JDBC-331](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-331))\
    Affected
    methods are: `getPrimaryKeys`, `getBestRowIdentifier`,
    `getImportedKeys`, `getExportedKeys` and `getCrossReference`. As
    part of this change `getIndexInfo` now handles names in the wrong
    case slightly different.Jaybird 3.0 will further modify and restrict
    the pattern matching and case sensitivity of metadata methods. See
    [Future changes to Jaybird].

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.3

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.3:

-   Fixed incorrect synchronization in native and embedded protocol (JNI)
    implementation for `iscBlobInfo` and `iscSeekBlob`
    ([JDBC-300](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-300))\
    WARNING: Although Jaybird strives for correct synchronization, a JDBC
    `Connection`, and its dependent objects should be used from a single
    `Thread` at a time, sharing on multiple threads concurrently is not
    advisable.
-   Fixed holdable `ResultSet` is closed on auto-commit
    ([JDBC-304](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-304),
    [JDBC-305](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-305))
-   Fixed table names missing or padded with spaces in Database view of
    IntelliJ IDEA
    ([JDBC-308](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-308),
    [IDEA-100786](http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-100786))
-   Fixed incorrect JDBC minor version reported under Java 7; this
    resulted in an incorrect column name (for Java 7) in the metadata of
    `DatabaseMetaData.getColumns(...)`
    ([JDBC-309](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-309))
-   Added `IOException` to cause of `GDSException` with error 335544721;
    "*Unable to complete network request to host ""*" for further
    investigation ([JDBC-306](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-306))

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.2

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.2:

-   Fixed: `FBMaintenanceManager.listLimboTransactions()` reports incorrect
    transaction id when the result contains multi-site transactions in limbo
    ([JDBC-266](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-266))
-   Fixed: Calling `PreparedStatement.setClob(int, Clob)` with a
    non-Firebird `Clob` (eg like Hibernate does) or calling
    `PreparedStatement.setClob(int, Reader)` throws `FBSQLException`:
    "You can't start before the beginning of the blob"
    ([JDBC-281](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-281))
-   Fixed: Connection property types not properly processed from
    `isc_dpb_types.properties`
    ([JDBC-284](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-284))
-   Fixed: JNI implementation of parameter buffer writes incorrect
    integers ([JDBC-285](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-285),
    [JDBC-286](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-286))
-   Changed: Throw `SQLException` when calling `execute`,
    `executeQuery`, `executeUpdate` and `addBatch` methods accepting a
    query string on a `PreparedStatement` or `CallableStatement` as
    required by JDBC 4.0
    ([JDBC-288](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-288))\
    NOTE: Be ware that this change can break existing code if you depended on
    the old, non-standard behavior! With `addBatch(String)` the old
    behavior lead to a memory leak and unexpected results.
-   Fixed: `LIKE` escape character JDBC escape (`{escape '<char>'}`)
    doesn't work
    ([JDBC-290](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-290))
-   Added: Support for a connect timeout using connection property
    `connectTimeout`. This property can be specified in the JDBC URL or
    `Propertie`s object or on the `DataSource`. If the `connectTimeout`
    property is not specified, the general `DriverManager` property
    `loginTimeout` is used. The value is the timeout in seconds.
    ([JDBC-295](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-295))\
    For the Java wire protocol the connect timeout will detect
    unreachable hosts. In the JNI implementation (native protocol) the
    connect timeout works as the DPB item `isc_dpb_connect_timeout`
    which only works after connecting to the server for the `op_accept`
    phase of the protocol. This means that – for the native protocol –
    the connect timeout will not detect unreachable hosts within
    the timeout. As that might be unexpected, an `SQLWarning` is added
    to the connection if the property is specified with the
    native protocol.
-   As part of the connect timeout change, hostname handling (if the
    hostname is an IP-address) in the Java wire protocol was changed.
    This should not have an impact in recent Java versions, but on older
    Java versions (Java 5 up to update 5) this might result in a delay
    in connecting using an IP-address, if that address can't be
    reverse-resolved to a hostname. Workaround is to add an entry for
    that IP-address to the `/etc/hosts` or `%WINDIR%\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` file.

### Changes and fixes in Jaybird 2.2.1

The following has been changed or fixed in Jaybird 2.2.1:

-   Fixed: `UnsatisfiedLinkError` in `libjaybird22(_x64).so undefined symbol: _ZTVN10__cxxabiv117__class_type_infoE`
    on Linux ([JDBC-259](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-259))
-   Added connection property `columnLabelForName` for backwards
    compatible behavior of `ResultSetMetaData#getColumnName(int)` and
    compatibility with bug in `com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl`
    ([JDBC-260](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-260))\
    Set property to `true` for backwards compatible behavior
    (`getColumnName()` returns the column label); don't set the property
    or set it to `false` for JDBC-compliant behavior (recommended).
-   Fixed:` setString(column, null)` on "`? IS (NOT) NULL`" condition
    does not set parameter to `NULL`
    ([JDBC-264](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-264))
-   The `charSet` connection property now accepts all aliases of the
    supported Java character sets (eg instead of only `Cp1252` now
    `windows-1252` is also accepted)
    ([JDBC-267](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-267))
-   Fixed: values of `charSet` property are case-sensitive
    ([JDBC-268](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-268))
-   Fixed: setting a parameter as `NULL` with the native protocol does
    not work when Firebird describes the parameter as not nullable
    ([JDBC-271](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-271))

### Changes and fixes since Jaybird 2.2.0 beta 1

The following was changed or fixed after the release of Jaybird 2.2.0
beta 1:

-   `ConcurrentModificationException` when closing connection
    obtained from `org.firebirdsql.ds.FBConnectionPoolDataSource` with
    statements open
    ([JDBC-250](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-250))
-   Memory leak when obtaining multiple connections for the same URL
    ([JDBC-249](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-249))
-   CPU spikes to 100% when using events and Firebird Server is stopped
    or unreachable
    ([JDBC-232](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-232))
-   Events do not work on Embedded
    ([JDBC-247](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-247))
-   Provide workaround for character set transliteration problems in
    database filenames and other connection properties
    ([JDBC-253](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-253)); see
    also [Support for Firebird 2.5].
-   `FBBackupManager` does not allow 16kb page size for restore
    ([JDBC-255](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-255))
-   Log warning and add warning on `Connection` when no explicit
    connection character set is specified
    ([JDBC-257](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-257))

Support for getGeneratedKeys()
------------------------------

Support was added for the `getGeneratedKeys()` functionality for
`Statement` and `PreparedStatement`.

There are four distinct use-cases:

1.  Methods accepting an `int` parameter with values
    of `Statement.NO_GENERATED_KEYS` and `Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS`

    When `NO_GENERATED_KEYS` is passed, the query will be executed as a
    normal query.

    When `RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS` is passed, the driver will add ***all***
    columns of the table in ordinal position order (as in the (JDBC)
    metadata of the table). It is advisable to retrieve the values from the
    `getGeneratedKeys()` result set by column name.

    We opted to include all columns as it is next to impossible to decide
    which columns are filled by a trigger or otherwise and only returning
    the primary key will be too limiting

2.  Methods accepting an `int[]` parameter with column indexes.

    The values in the `int[]` parameter are the ordinal positions of the
    columns as specified in the (JDBC) metadata of the table. For a null or
    empty array the statement is processed as is. Invalid ordinal positions
    are ignored and silently dropped (be aware: the JDBC specification is
    not entirely clear if this is valid behavior, so this might change in
    the future)

3.  Methods accepting a `String[]` parameter with column names.

    The values in the `String[]` are the column names to be returned. The
    column names provided are processed as is and are not checked for
    validity or the need of quoting. Providing non-existent or incorrectly
    (un)quoted columns will result in an exception when the statement is
    processed by Firebird.

    This method is the fastest as it does not retrieve metadata from the
    server.

4.  Providing a query already containing a `RETURNING` clause. In this
    case all of the previous cases are ignored and the query is executed
    as is. It is possible to retrieve the result set using
    `getGeneratedKeys()`.

This functionality will only be available if the ANTLR 3.4 runtime
classes are on the classpath. Except for calling methods with
`NO_GENERATED_KEYS`, absence of the ANTLR runtime will throw
`FBDriverNotCapableException`.

This functionality should work for `INSERT` (from Firebird 2.0), and for
`UPDATE`, `UPDATE OR INSERT` and `DELETE` (from Firebird 2.1).

Java 6 and JDBC 4.0 API support
-------------------------------

Support was added for the following JDBC 4.0 features:

-   Automatic driver loading: on Java 6 and later it is no longer necessary
    to use `Class.forName("org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver")` to load the driver
-   Implementation of `java.sql.Wrapper` interface on various JDBC
    classes; in general it only unwraps to the specific implementation
    class (and superclasses) and implemented interfaces
-   Support for chained exceptions (use `getNextException()` and
    `iterator()` to view other, related exceptions) and `getCause()` to
    retrieve the cause (deprecating similar `getInternalException()`)
-   Support for `getClientInfo()` and `setClientInfo()` on `Connection`

Java 7 and JDBC 4.1 API support
-------------------------------

Support was added for the following JDBC 4.1 features:

-   try-with-resources [^2]
-   Statement `closeOnCompletion`

Other methods added by JDBC 4.1 will throw `FBDriverNotCapableException`
(a subclass of `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`).

[^2]: See <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html>

Java 8 and JDBC 4.2 API support
-------------------------------

Minimal support for JDBC 4.2 was added in Jaybird 2.2.4 and extended in 2.2.5:

-   Large update counts: no actual support is provided, method call
    is forwarded to the normal update count method returning an `int`.
-   Methods accepting `java.sql.SQLType`: no actual support is provided,
    method call is forwarded to equivalent method accepting a
    `java.sql.Types` integer value.
-   `PreparedStatement.setObject()` and `ResultSet.updateObject()` now
    accept `java.time` objects:

    |                           |`DATE`|`TIME`|`TIMESTAMP`|`(VAR)CHAR`|`BLOB SUB_TYPE TEXT`
    |---------------------------|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:---------:|:-------------------:
    |`java.time.LocalTime`      |      |  X   |           |     X     |          X
    |`java.time.LocalDate`      |   X  |      |           |     X     |          X
    |`java.time.LocalDateTime`  |   X  |  X   |     X     |     X     |          X
    |`java.time.OffsetTime`     |      |      |           |     X     |          X
    |`java.time.OffsetDateTime` |      |      |           |     X     |          X

-   Retrieval of `java.time` objects using `getObject(int, Class<?>)`
    and `getObject(String, Class<?>)` is not yet supported.

Jaybird on Maven
----------------

Jaybird @VERSION@ is available on maven, with a separate artifact
for each supported Java version.

Groupid: `org.firebirdsql.jdbc`, artifactid: `jaybird-jdkXX` (where `XX` is 
`16`, `17` or `18`).\
Version: `@VERSION@`

For example:

~~~ {.xml}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.firebirdsql.jdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaybird-jdk18</artifactId>
    <version>@VERSION@</version>
</dependency>
~~~

When deploying to a JavaEE environment, exclude the `javax.resource`
`connector-api` dependency as this will be provided by the application
server.

Native and Embedded (JNI) 64-bit Windows and Linux support
----------------------------------------------------------

The JNI libraries for native and embedded support now also have a 64 bit version.

Support for Firebird 2.5
------------------------

Added support for Firebird 2.5 Services API enhancements:

-   The security database can be set
-   Support for SET/DROP AUTO ADMIN
-   Mapping for new role RDB\$ADMIN in security database
-   Added new Firebird 2.1 shutdown/online modes available in Firebird 2.5
    via the Services API
-   Support for NBackup via Services API in Firebird 2.5
-   Support for Trace/Audit via Services API in Firebird 2.5

Since Firebird 2.5, Firebird supports full UTF-8 database filenames and
other connection properties (Database Parameter Buffer values). Jaybird
does not yet support these changes, but a workaround is available:

This workaround consists of two steps:

1.  Ensure your Java application is executed with the system 
    property `file.encoding=UTF-8` (either because that is the default 
    encoding for your OS, or by explicitly specifying this property on 
    the commandline of your application using `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8`)
2.  Include property `utf8_filename=1` in the JDBC URL or (non-standard)
    properties of the datasource

This will only work if the Firebird server is version 2.5 or higher.

Support for Firebird 3.0
------------------------

Jaybird 2.2.x only supports Firebird 3.0 using the legacy
authentication. The new authentication model and wire protocol
encryption is not yet supported. Technically these new protocol options
will work when using the Type 2 driver, but this hasn't been fully
tested.

When using Jaybird with Firebird 3.0, make sure that

-   Wire protocol encryption is not set to `Required` (set it to `Enabled` or
    `Disabled`)
-   Legacy authentication is enabled on server
-   The user has been created with the legacy usermanager

The new `BOOLEAN` data type is supported

See [Jaybird and Firebird 3](https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/jaybird/wiki/Jaybird-and-Firebird-3)
for more details.

Improved support for OpenOffice / LibreOffice Base
--------------------------------------------------

The interpretation of the JDBC standard by Jaybird differs from the
interpretation by OpenOffice / LibreOffice. To address some of the
problems caused by these differences, Jaybird now provides a separate
protocol for OpenOffice / LibreOffice.

When connecting from Base, use the protocol prefix
`jdbc:firebirdsql:oo:`. Be aware that this is a variant of the pure Java
wire protocol and not the native or embedded protocol.

Issues addressed by this protocol:

-   Result sets are not closed when a statements is finished (eg fully
    read `ResultSet` or when creating a new Statement in auto-commit mode)
-   `DatabaseMetaData#getTablePrivileges(...)` reports privileges
    granted to `PUBLIC` and to the current role (as reported by
    `CURRENT_ROLE`) as being granted to the user *(after Jaybird 2.2.0
    beta 1)*.

Use `isc_tpb_autocommit` in auto commit mode (experimental)
-----------------------------------------------------------

*Added in Jaybird 2.2.9*

This option is enabled by specifying the connection property
`useFirebirdAutocommit=true`.

With this option, Jaybird will configure the transaction to use
`isc_tpb_autocommit` with `autoCommit=true`. This means that Firebird server
will internally commit the transaction after each statement completion. Jaybird 
itself will not commit until connection close (or switching to 
`autoCommit=false`). The exception is if the statement was of type 
`isc_info_sql_stmt_ddl`, in that case Jaybird will commit on statement success
and rollback on statement failure (just like it does for all statements in
normal auto commit mode). The reason is that Firebird for some DDL commands only
executes at a real commit boundary and relying on the Firebird auto-commit is
insufficient.

On statement completion (as specified in JDBC), result sets will still close
unless they are holdable over commit. The result set is only closed client side,
which means that the cursor remains open server side to prevent roundtrips. This
may lead to additional resource usage server side unless explicitly closed in
the code. Note that any open blobs will be closed client- and server-side (until
this is improved with [JDBC-401](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-401)).

A connection can be interrogated using 
`FirebirdConnection.isUseFirebirdAutocommit()` if it uses `isc_tpb_autocommit`.

If you manually add `isc_tpb_autocommit` to the transaction parameter buffer and
you enable this option, the `isc_tpb_autocommit` will be removed from the TPB 
if `autoCommit=false`.

Artificial testing with repeated inserts (using a prepared statement) against a
Firebird server on localhost shows that this leads to a reduction of execution
time of +/- 7%.

Support for this option is experimental, and should only be enabled if you 
1) know what you're doing, and 2) really need this feature. Internally 
`isc_tpb_autocommit` uses `commit_retaining`, which means that using this 
feature may increase the transaction gap with associated sweep and garbage 
collection impact.

Other fixes and changes
-----------------------

-   Replaced `mini-j2ee.jar` with `connector-api-1.5.jar`: make sure to remove
    the old `mini-j2ee.jar` from the classpath of your application.
-   Dropped `jaybird-pool` jar from the distribution (all classes are included
    in the `jaybird` jar and the `jaybird-full` jar).
-   `FBResultSetMetaData#getcolumnName(int)` will now return the original column
    name (if available) for compliance with the JDBC specification, 
    `getColumnLabel(int)` will still return the alias (or the column name if no
    alias is defined). See [Compatibility with `com.sun.rowset.*`] for potential
    problems when using the reference implementation of `CachedRowSet`.\
    Jaybird 2.2.1 introduced the connection property `columnLabelForName` which
    will revert to the old behavior when set to `true`. Be aware that the old
    behavior is not JDBC-compliant.
-   `FBDatabaseMetaData` has been updated to include metadata columns defined by
    JDBC 3.0, 4.0 and 4.1. This also changes the position of `OWNER_NAME` column
    in the result set of `getTables(..) `as this column is Jaybird-specific and
    not defined in JDBC.
-   `FBDatabaseMetaData#getIndexInfo(..)` now also returns expression indexes.
    The `COLUMN_NAME` column will contain the expression (if available).
-   `FBDatabaseMetaData#getIndexInfo(..)` now correctly limits the returned
    indexes to unique indexes when parameter `unique` is set to `true`.
-   The connection property `octetsAsBytes` can be used to identify fields with
    `CHARACTER SET OCTETS` as being `(VAR)BINARY` (in `ResultSetMetaData` only).
-   The `getTime(`), `getDate()`, `getTimestamp()` methods which take a 
    `Calendar` object now correctly handle conversions around Daylight Savings
    Time (DST) changes. Before, the time was first converted to the local JVM
    timezone, and then to the timezone of the provided `Calendar`, this could
    lose up to an hour in time. Now the time is converted directly to the
    timezone of the provided `Calendar`. ([JDBC-154](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-154))

Compatibility changes
=====================

Jaybird 2.2 introduces some changes in compatibility and announces future 
breaking changes. The version previously announced as Jaybird 2.3 will be 
released as Jaybird 3.0.

Java support
------------

Java 5 support has been dropped starting with Jaybird 2.2.8 as Java 5 has been
on End-Of-Public-Updates[^3]status since October 2009.

Java 6 support will be dropped for Jaybird 3.0 as Java 6 has been on
End-Of-Public-Updates status since February 2013. This is a change from previous
announcements that support would be dropped with Jaybird 3.1.

Java 7 support will be dropped for Jaybird 3.1 as Java 7 has been on 
End-Of-Public-Updates status since April 2015.

Java 9 support is expected to be introduced with Jaybird 3.0. There are no plans
to add Java 9 support to Jaybird 2.2.x, although the driver is expected to
function if JDBC 4.3 specific features are avoided.

For compatibility with Java 9 modules, versions 2.2.14 and 3.0.3 introduced the 
automatic module name `org.firebirdsql.jaybird`. This guarantees a stable module 
name for Jaybird, and allows for future modularization of Jaybird. 

[^3]: See <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html>

Firebird support
----------------

Jaybird 2.2 supports Firebird 1.0 and higher, but is only tested with Firebird
2.1, 2.5 and 3.0. 

Firebird 4 is not formally supported in Jaybird 2.2.x, although connecting and 
most functionality will work.

Firebird 1.0 and 1.5 support will be dropped with Jaybird 3.0. In general this 
should not impact the use of the driver, but might have impact on the 
availability and use of metadata information. This also means that starting with
Jaybird 3.0, bugs that only occur with Firebird 1.0 and 1.5 will not be fixed.

Firebird 2.0 support will be dropped with Jaybird 3.1.

Important changes to Datasources
--------------------------------

The `ConnectionPoolDataSource` and `XADataSource` implementations in
`org.firebirdsql.pool` and `org.firebirdsql.pool.sun` contain several
bugs with regard to pool and connection management when used by a JavaEE
application server. The decision was made to write new implementations
in the package `org.firebirdsql.ds`.

The following implementation classes have been deprecated and will be
removed in Jaybird 3.0:

-   `org.firebirdsql.pool.DriverConnectionPoolDataSource`
-   `org.firebirdsql.pool.FBConnectionPoolDataSource`
-   `org.firebirdsql.pool.sun.AppServerDataSource`
-   `org.firebirdsql.pool.sun.AppServerXADataSource`
-   `org.firebirdsql.jca.FBXADataSource`
-   `org.firebirdsql.pool.SimpleDataSource`

Their replacement classes are:

-   `org.firebirdsql.ds.FBConnectionPoolDataSource`
-   `org.firebirdsql.ds.FBXADataSource`
-   `org.firebirdsql.ds.FBSimpleDataSource` (a normal `DataSource`)

We strongly urge you to switch to these new implementations if you are
using these classes in an application server. The bugs are described in
[JDBC-86](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-86),
[JDBC-93](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-93),
[JDBC-131](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-131) and
[JDBC-144](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-144).

The deprecated classes can still be used with the `DataSource`
implementations `WrappingDataSource` as the identified bugs do not occur
with this implementation, but we advise you to switch to
`FBSimpleDataSource`. If you require a standalone connection pool
(outside an application server) or statement pooling, please consider
using a third-party connection pool like C3P0, DBCP or HikariCP.

The new `ConnectionPoolDataSource` and `XADataSource` implementations
only provide the basic functionality specified in the JDBC
specifications and do **not** provide any pooling itself. The
`ConnectionPoolDataSource` and `XADataSource` are intended to be **used
by** connection pools (as provided by application servers) and should
not be connection pools themselves.

Future changes to Jaybird
-------------------------

The next versions of Jaybird will include some – potentially – breaking
changes. We advise to check your code if you will be affected by these
changes and prepare for these changes if possible.

### Removal of deprecated classes, packages and (interface) methods

As announced above, the `ConnectionPoolDataSource` implementations in
`org.firebirdsql.pool` and `org.firebirdsql.jca` will be removed in
Jaybird 3.0. The entire `org.firebirdsql.pool` package will be removed.

The following (deprecated) classes will also be removed:

-   `org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBWrappingDataSource` (old deprecated class
    subclassing `org.firebirdsql.pool.FBWrappingDataSource`), only included in
    `jaybird-full` jar

Furthermore the following interfaces will be removed as they are no
longer needed:

-  `FirebirdSavepoint` (identical to `java.sql.Savepoint`)

The following interfaces will have some of the methods removed:

- `FirebirdConnection`
    -   `setFirebirdSavepoint()` replace with `Connection#setSavepoint()`
    -   `setFirebirdSavepoint(String name)` replace with `Connection#setSavepoint(String name)`
    -   `rollback(FirebirdSavepoint savepoint)` replace with `Connection#rollback(Savepoint savepoint)`
    -   `releaseSavepoint(FirebirdSavepoint savepoint)` replace with
        `Connection#releaseSavepoint(Savepoint savepoint)`

Visibility of the following classes will be reduced as they are implementation
artifacts and should not be considered API:

- `org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriverPropertyManager` (to package private)

If you are still using these interfaces, classes or methods, please change your
code to use the JDBC interface or method instead.

In `FBMaintenanceManager` the following changes will be made:

- `getLimboTransactions()` will return `long[]` instead of `int[]`
- `limboTransactionsAsList()` will return `List<Long>` instead of `List<Integer>`
- `getLimboTransactionsAsLong()` (introduced in 2.2.11) will be removed in favor of `getLimboTransactions()`
- `limboTransactionsAsLongList` (introduced in 2.2.11) will be removed in favor of `limboTransactionsAsList`

These methods were previously not defined in the `MaintenanceManager` interface.

### Handling `(VAR)CHAR CHARACTER SET OCTETS` as `(VAR)BINARY` type

From Jaybird 3.0 on `(VAR)CHAR CHARACTER SET OCTETS` will be considered to be of
`java.sql.Types` type `(VAR)BINARY`. This should not impact normal use of 
methods like `get/setString()`, but will impact the metadata and the type of 
object returned by `getObject()` (a byte array instead of a String).

The connection property `octetsAsBytes` will no longer have an effect in 
Jaybird 3.

### Handling connections without explicit connection character set

When no connection character set has been specified (properties
`lc_ctype` or `encoding` with Firebird character set, or `charSet` or
`localEncoding` with Java character set), Jaybird will currently use the
`NONE` character set. This means that the Firebird server will return
the bytes for `(VAR)CHAR` columns as they are stored, while Jaybird will
convert between bytes and Strings using the local platform encoding.

This default has the potential of corrupting data when switching
platforms or using the same database with different local encodings, or
for transliteration errors when the database character set does not
accept some byte combinations.

Jaybird 3 will reject a connection if no explicit character set has been 
specified (see [JDBC-257](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-257) and
[JDBC-446](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-446)).

For the time being, Jaybird 2.2 will log a warning and add a warning on 
the `Connection` when no explicit character set was specified.

Review your use of the connection character sets and change it if you
are not specifying it explicitly. Be aware that changing this may
require you to fix the data as it is currently stored in your database
if your database character set does not match the local platform
encoding of your Java application. If you are sure that `NONE` is the
correct character set for you, specify it explicitly in your connection
string or connection properties.

### Replacement or upgrade of logging library

Logging in Jaybird 3.0 will be changed. Support for Log4J will be removed and we
will switch to `java.util.logging`.

### Stricter JDBC compliance for `DatabaseMetaData` methods

The current implementation of `DatabaseMetaData` methods do not conform
to the JDBC specification when it comes to case sensitivity and quoted
object names.

In Jaybird 3.0 meta data methods will no longer do the following:

-   Remove quotes around object names
-   Trying the uppercase value, when the original parameter value
    failed to produce results

For example:

~~~ {.sql}
CREATE TABLE tablename (
   column1 INTEGER,
   "column2" INTEGER
);
~~~

In Jaybird 2.2 using `getColumns(null, null, "tablename", "column%")`
will return `COLUMN1`(!). Unquoted object names are stored uppercase in
Firebird, so in Jaybird 3.0 this will produce **no rows** as `tablename`
does not match `TABLENAME`.

Changing the query to `getColumns(null, null, "TABLENAME", "column%")`
in Jaybird 2.2 and 3.0 will only produce **one row** (with `column2`),
as `COLUMN1` does not match `column%`.

In Jaybird 2.2 using
`getColumns(null, null, "\"TABLENAME\"", "column%")` will return
`column2` as the quotes will be stripped, with Jaybird 3.0 this will
produce **no rows**.

Distribution package
====================

The following file groups can be found in distribution package:

-   `jaybird-@VERSION@.jar` – archive containing JCA/JDBC driver, implementation
    of connection pooling and statement pooling interfaces, and JMX management
    class. It requires JCA 1.5.
-   `jaybird-full-@VERSION@.jar` – merge of `jaybird-@VERSION@.jar`
    and `connector-api-1.5.jar`.\
    This archive can be used for standalone Jaybird deployments, it
    should not be used within application servers.
-   `jaybird-@VERSION@-sources.jar` – archive containing the sources of
    Jaybird (specific to this JDK version); for including Jaybird
    sources in your IDE.
-   `lib/connector-api-1.5.jar` – archive containing JCA 1.5 classes (required dependency).
-   `lib/antlr-runtime-3.4.jar` – archive containing ANTLR runtime
    classes, required for generated keys functionality (optional dependency).
-   `lib/log4j-core.jar` – archive containing core Log4J classes that provide logging
    (optional dependency).

Jaybird has compile-time and run-time dependencies on the JCA 1.5
classes. Additionally, if Log4J classes are found in the class path, it
is possible to enable extensive logging inside the driver. If the ANTLR
runtime classes are absent, the generated keys functionality will not be
available.

Native dependencies (required only for Type 2 and Embedded):

-   `jaybird22.dll` – Windows 32-bit
-   `jaybird22_x64.dll` – Windows 64-bit
-   `libjaybird22.so` – Linux 32-bit (x86)
-   `libjaybird22_x64.so` – Linux 64-bit (AMD/Intel 64)

The Windows DLLs have been built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SP1.
To use the native or embedded driver, you will need to install the
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP 1 redistributable available at:

-   x86: <http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8328>
-   x64: <http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13523>

extension interface (but not abstract or concrete class) is considered
by the authors of Jaybird to be dynamic linking. Hence our
interpretation of the LGPL is that the use of the unmodified Jaybird
source does not affect the license of your application code.

Even more, all extension interfaces to which application might want to
link are released under dual LGPL/modified BSD license. Latter is
basically "AS IS" license that allows any kind of use of that source
code. Jaybird should be viewed as an implementation of that interfaces
and LGPL section for dynamic linking is applicable in this case.

Corrections/Additions to Release Notes
--------------------------------------

Please send corrections, suggestions, or additions to these Release
Notes to the mailing list at <Firebird-Java@yahoogroups.com>.

JDBC URL Format
===============

Jaybird provides different JDBC URLs for different usage scenarios:

Pure Java
---------

    jdbc:firebirdsql://host[:port]/<database>

Default URL, will connect to the database using the Type 4 JDBC driver
using the Java implementation of the Firebird wire-protocol. Best suited
for client-server applications with dedicated database server. Port can
be omitted (default value is `3050`), host name must be present.

The `<database>` part should be replaced with the database alias or the
path to the database. In general it is advisable to uses database aliases
instead of the path the file.

On Linux the root `/` should be included in the path. A database located on
`/opt/firebird/db.fdb` should use the URL below (note the double slash after port!).

    jdbc:firebirdsql://host:port//opt/firebird/db.fdb

Deprecated but still available alternative URL:

    jdbc:firebirdsql:host[/port]:<database>

Using Firebird client library
-----------------------------

    jdbc:firebirdsql:native:host[/port]:<database>

Type 2 driver, will connect to the database using client library
(`fbclient.dll` on Windows, and `libfbclient.so` on Linux). Requires
correct installation of the client library.

    jdbc:firebirdsql:local:<database>

Type 2 driver in local mode. Uses client library as in previous case,
however will not use socket communication, but rather access database
directly. Requires correct installation of the client library.

Embedded Server
---------------

    jdbc:firebirdsql:embedded:<database>

Similar to the Firebird client library, however `fbembed.dll` on Windows
and `libfbembed.so` on Linux are used. Requires correctly installed and
configured Firebird embedded library.

Using Type 2 and Embedded Server driver
=======================================

Jaybird 2.2 provides a Type 2 JDBC driver that uses the native client
library to connect to the databases. Additionally Jaybird 2.2 can use
the embedded version of Firebird so Java applications do not require a
separate server setup.

However the Type 2 driver has its limitations:

Due to multi-threading issues in the Firebird client library as well as
in the embedded server version, it is not possible to access a single
connection from different threads simultaneously. When using the client
library only one thread is allowed to access a connection at a time.
Access to different connections from different threads is however
allowed. Client library in local mode and embedded server library on
Linux do not allow multithreaded access to the library. Jaybird provides
necessary synchronization in Java code, however the mutex is local to
the classloader that loaded the Jaybird driver.

**Care should be taken when deploying applications in web or application
servers: put jar files in the main library directory of the web and/or
application server, not in the library directory of the web or
enterprise application (WEB-INF/lib directory or in the .EAR file).**

Configuring Type 2 JDBC driver
------------------------------

The Type 2 JDBC driver requires the Jaybird JNI library to be installed
and available to the Java Virtual Machine. Precompiled binaries for
Windows and Linux platforms are distributed with Jaybird.

**Please note that Jaybird 2.2 provides an update to the JNI libraries
to support new features. It is not compatible with the JNI library for
Jaybird 2.1 or earlier.**

-   `jaybird22.dll / jaybird22_x64.dll` is a precompiled binary for the
    Windows platform. It was successfully tested with Windows XP and
    Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10, but there should be no issues in
    other Windows OS versions (as long as the MS Visual C++ 2010 SP1
    distributable is available). The library should be copied into a
    directory in the `PATH` environment variable, or be made available to
    the JVM using the `java.library.path` system property.
-   `libjaybird22.so / libjaybird22_x64.so` is a precompiled binary for
    the Linux platform (AMD/Intel). It must be available via
    the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, or be made available to
    the JVM using the `java.library.path` system property. Dependent
    libraries (`libfbclient.so` or `libfbembed.so`) need to be on
    the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. The `java.library.path` is ignored for these
    libraries as they are loaded from the JNI library, and not from Java.
    Some Firebird distributions will not create `libfbclient.so` (but
    only `libfbclient.so.2` and `.so.2.5`), you will need to add a symlink
    with the name as expected by Jaybird.
-   Other platforms can compile the JNI library by checking out the Jaybird
    sources from GitHub and using `./build.sh compile-native` command
    in the directory with checked out sources.

After making Jaybird JNI library available to the JVM, the application
has to tell driver to start using this by either specifying TYPE2 or
LOCAL type in the connection pool or data source properties or using
appropriate JDBC URL when connecting via `java.sql.DriverManager`.

Configuring Embedded Server JDBC driver
---------------------------------------

The Embedded Server JDBC driver uses the same JNI library and
configuration steps for the Type 2 JDBC driver.

There is however one issue related to the algorithm of Firebird Embedded
Server installation directory resolution. Firebird server uses a pluggable
architecture for internationalization. By default server loads
`fbintl.dll` or `libfbintl.so` library that contains various character
encodings and collation orders. This library is expected to be installed in
the `intl/` subdirectory of the server installation. The algorithm of
directory resolution is the following:

1.  `FIREBIRD` environment variable.
1.  `RootDirectory` parameter in the `firebird.conf` file.
2.  The directory where server binary is located.

When Embedded Server is used from Java and no `FIREBIRD` environment
variable is specified, it tries to find `firebird.conf` in the directory
where the application binary is located. In our case the application binary is
the JVM and therefore Embedded Server tries to find its configuration file
in the `bin/` directory of the JDK or JRE installation. The same happens to
the last item of the list. In most cases this is not desired behavior.

Therefore, if the application uses character encodings, UDFs or wants to
fine-tune server behavior through the configuration file, the `FIREBIRD`
environment variable must be specified and point to the installation
directory of the Embedded Server, e.g. current working directory.

Support for multiple JNI libraries
----------------------------------

Up to Jaybird 2.0 only one client library could be loaded in a single
JVM. That could be either an embedded Firebird library (`fbembed.dll`/`libfbembed.so`),
or Firebird client library (`fbclient.dll`/`libfbclient.so`). This could
lead to problems, For example, if embedded Firebird was used first, the
JDBC driver would access the database file directly instead of using the
local IPC protocol if only the path to the database was specified. It
was not possible to change this without restarting the JVM.

Since Jaybird 2.1, Jaybird is able to correctly load arbitrary number of
shared libraries that implement the ISC API and forward the requests
correctly depending on the type of the driver being used.

Usage and Reference Manual
==========================

Events
------

Events is one of the unique features in the Firebird RDBMS and allows
asynchronous notification of the applications about named events that
happen in the database. Information on this feature can found in the
free IB 6.0 documentation set as well as in The Firebird Book by Helen
Borrie.

The interfaces and classes for the event support can be found in
`org.firebirdsql.event` package, which includes:

-   `EventManager` interface to register for the synchronous and
    asynchronous notification about the events in the database;
-   `EventListener` interface which has to be implemented by the
    application that wants to participate in the asynchronous notification;
-   `DatabaseEvent` interface which represents the object that will be
    passed to the `EventListener` notification method;
-   Implementation of the above interfaces: `FBEventManager` and
    `FBDatabaseEvent`.

**Please note, that each instance of `FBEventManager` will open a new
socket connection to the Firebird server on the port specified by
Firebird.**

Similar to other JDBC extensions in Jaybird, the interfaces are released
under the modified BSD license, the implementation of the code is
released under LGPL license.

Default holdable result sets (closed ResultSet in auto-commit mode)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This connection property allows to create holdable result sets by
default. This is needed as a workaround for the applications that do not
follow JDBC specification in regard to the auto-commit mode.

Specifically, such applications open a result set and, while traversing
it, execute other statements using the same connection. According to
JDBC specification the result set has to be closed if another statement
is executed using the same connection in auto-commit mode. Among others
the OpenOffice/LibreOffice Base users have problems with the JDBC
compatibility in Jaybird.

The property is called:

-   `defaultResultSetHoldable` as connection property for JDBC URL or for
    `java.sql.DriverManager` class and no or empty value should be assigned
     to it; it has an alias `defaultHoldable` to simplify the typing;
-   `isc_dpb_result_set_holdable` as a DPB member;
-   `FirebirdConnectionProperties` interface methods `isDefaultResultSetHoldable()`
    and `setDefaultResultSetHoldable(boolean)`

**Note, the price for using this feature is that each holdable result
set will be fully cached in memory. The memory occupied by it will be
released when the statement that produced the result set is either
closed or re-executed.**

Updatable result sets
---------------------

Jaybird provides support for updatable result sets. This feature allows
a Java application to update the current record using the
`update`*`XXX`* methods of `java.sql.ResultSet` interface. Updates are
performed within the current transaction using a best row identifier
in the `WHERE`-clause. This sets the following limitation on the result set
"updatability":

-   the `SELECT` references a single table;
-   all columns not referenced in `SELECT` permit `NULL`s (otherwise
    `INSERT`s will fail);
-   the `SELECT` statement does not contain a `DISTINCT` predicate,
    aggregate functions, joined tables or stored procedures;
-   the `SELECT` statement references all columns from the table primary
    key definition or a `RDB$DB_KEY` column.

Firebird management interfaces
------------------------------

Jaybird provides full support of the Firebird Services API that allows
Java applications to perform various server management tasks:

-   database backup/restore on remote server; it is possible to performs
    metadata-only backups, switch the garbage collection during backup off,
    restore databases with no validity constraints or active indices, etc.
-   database maintenance, e.g. database shutdown, sweep, changing the
    forced writes settings, changing SQL dialect of the database, shadow
    management, etc.
-   retrieving database statistics including header page statistics,
    system table statistics, data page statistics and index statistics.
-   user management, including adding, modifying, and deleting
    user accounts.

Jaybird JDBC extensions
-----------------------

Jaybird provides extensions to some JDBC interfaces. JDBC extension
interface classes are released under modified BSD license, on "AS IS"
and "do what you want" basis, this should make linking to these classes
safe from the legal point of view. All classes belong to
`org.firebirdsql.jdbc.*` package.

The table below shows all JDBC extensions present in Jaybird with a
driver version in which the extension was introduced.

|Interface                     |Since|Method name                             |Description

[^4]: To be removed in Jaybird 3.0

JDBC connection properties
--------------------------

The table below lists the properties for the connections that are obtained
from this data source. Commonly used parameters have the corresponding
getter and setter methods, the rest of the Database Parameters Block
parameters can be set using `setNonStandardProperty` setter method.

|Property           |Getter|Setter|Description
|-------------------|:----:|:----:|--------------------------------------------
|`database`         |+     |+     |(**deprecated**) Path to the database in the format `[host/port:]<database>`. This property is not specified in the JDBC standard. Use the the standard defined `serverName`, `portNumber` and `databaseName` instead.
|`serverName`       |+     |+     |Hostname or IP address of the Firebird server
|`portNumber`       |+     |+     |Portnumber of the Firebird server
|`databaseName`     |+     |+     |Database alias or full-path
|`type`             |+     |+     |Type of the driver to use. Possible values are: `PURE_JAVA` or `TYPE4` for type 4 JDBC driver, `NATIVE` or `TYPE2` for type 2 JDBC driver, `EMBEDDED` for using embedded version of the Firebird.
|`blobBufferSize`   |+     |+     |Size of the buffer used to transfer blob content. Maximum value is 64k-1.
|`socketBufferSize` |+     |+     |Size of the socket buffer. Needed on some Linux machines to fix performance degradation.
|`buffersNumber`    |+     |+     |Number of cache buffers (in database pages) that will be allocated for the connection. Makes sense for ClassicServer only.
|`charSet`          |+     |+     |Character set for the connection. Similar to `encoding` property, but accepts Java names instead of Firebird ones.
|`encoding`         |+     |+     |Character encoding for the connection. See Firebird documentation for more information.
|`useTranslation`   |+     |+     |Path to the properties file containing character translation map.
|`password`         |+     |+     |Corresponding password.
|`roleName`         |+     |+     |SQL role to use.
|`userName`         |+     |+     |Name of the user that will be used by default.
|`useStreamBlobs`   |+     |+     |Boolean flag tells driver whether stream blobs should be created by the driver, by default false. Stream blobs allow `seek` operation to be called.
|`useStandardUdf`   |+     |+     |Boolean flag tells driver to assume that standard UDFs are defined in the database. This extends the set of functions available via escaped function calls. This does not affect non-escaped use of functions.
|`defaultResultSetHoldable`|+     |+     |Boolean flag tells driver to construct the default result set to be holdable. This prevents it from closing in auto-commit mode if another statement is executed over the same connection.
|`tpbMapping`       |+     |+     |TPB mapping for different transaction isolation modes.
|`defaultIsolation` |+     |+     |Default transaction isolation level. All newly created connections will have this isolation level. One of: `TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED`, `TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ`, `TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE`
|`defaultTransactionIsolation`|+     |+     |Integer value from `java.sql.Connection` interface corresponding to the transaction isolation level specified in isolation property.
|`nonStandardProperty`|      |      |Allows to set any valid connection property that does not have corresponding setter method. Two setters are available: `setNonStandardProperty(String)` method takes only one parameter in form `propertyName[=propertyValue]`, this allows setting non-standard parameters using configuration files. `setNonStandardProperty(String, String)` takes property name as first parameter, and its value as the second parameter.
|`connectTimeout`   |+     |+     |The connect timeout in seconds. For the Java wire protocol detects unreachable hosts, for JNI (native protocol) only defines a timeout during the `op_accept` phase after connecting to the server.
|`useFirebirdAutocommit`|+     |+     |(**experimental**) When enabled Jaybird does not commit on JDBC auto-commit boundaries, but instead relies on the `isc_tpb_autocommit` feature of Firebird.

JDBC Compatibility
==================

The Jaybird driver is not officially JDBC-compliant as the certification
procedure is too expensive. The following lists some of the differences
between JDBC specification and Jaybird implementation. This list is not
exhaustive.

JDBC deviations and unimplemented features
------------------------------------------

The following optional features and the methods for their support are
not implemented:

-   `java.sql.Array` data type is not (yet) supported
-   `java.sql.Blob` does not implement following methods:
    -   `position(Blob, long)` and `position(byte[], long)`; Firebird does
        not provide any server-side optimization for these calls, client
        application must fetch complete blob content from the server to do
        pattern search.
    -   `truncate(long)`; Firebird does not provide such functionality on
        the server side, application must fetch old BLOB from the server
        and pump old content into a newly created blob.
-   `java.sql.Connection`
    -   `getCatalog()` and `setCatalog(String)` are not supported by
        Firebird server
    -   `getTypeMap()` and `setTypeMap(Map)` are not supported
-   `java.sql.Ref` data type is not supported by Firebird server
-   `java.sql.SQLData` data type is not supported by Firebird server
-   `java.sql.SQLInput` is not supported
-   `java.sql.SQLOutput` is not supported
-   `java.sql.SQLXML` is not supported
-   `java.sql.RowId` is not supported
-   `java.sql.NClob` is not supported
-   `java.sql.Statement`
    -   `cancel()` is implemented, but not fully supported by Jaybird
-   `java.sql.Struct` data type is not supported by server.

The following methods are implemented, but deviate from the
specification:

-   `java.sql.Statement`
    -   `get/setMaxFieldSize` does nothing, Firebird server does not
        support this feature.
    -   `get/setQueryTimeout` does nothing, Firebird server does not
        support this feature.
-   `java.sql.PreparedStatement`
    -   `setObject(int index, Object object, int type)` Target SQL type
        is determined from the class of the passed object and
        corresponding parameter is ignored.
    -   `setObject(int index, Object object, int type, int scale)`
        Same as above, type and scale are ignored.
-   `java.sql.ResultSetMetaData`
    -   `isReadOnly()` always returns false
    -   `isWritable()` always returns true
    -   `isDefinitivelyWritable()` always returns true

Jaybird Specifics
=================

Jaybird has some implementation-specific issues that should be
considered during development.

Result sets
-----------

Jaybird behaves differently not only when different result set types are
used but also whether the connection is in auto-commit mode or not.

-   `ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY` result sets when used in auto-commit mode
    are completely cached on the client before the execution of the query
    is finished. This leads to the increased time needed to execute
    statement, however the result set navigation happens almost instantly.
    When auto-commit mode is switched off, only part of the result set
    specified by the fetch size is cached on the client.
-   `ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE` result sets are always cached on
    the client. The reason is quite simple – the Firebird API does not (yet)
    provide scrollable cursor support, navigation is possible only in one
    direction.
-   `ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT` holdability is supported in Jaybird
    only for result sets of type `ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE`.
    For other result set types driver will throw an exception.

Using `java.sql.ParameterMetaData` with callable Statements
------------------------------------------------------------

This interface can be used only to obtain information about the IN
parameters. Also it is not allowed to call the
`PreparedStatement.getParameterMetaData` method before all of the OUT
parameters are registered. Otherwise the corresponding method of
`CallableStatement` throws an `SQLException`, because the driver
tries to prepare the procedure call with incorrect number of parameters.

Using `ResultSet.getCharacterStream` with blob fields
-----------------------------------------------------

Jaybird JDBC driver always uses connection encoding when converting
array of bytes into character stream. The `BLOB SUB_TYPE 1` fields allow
setting the character encoding for the field. However when the contents
of the field is sent to the client, it is not converted according to the
character set translation rules in Firebird, but is sent "as is". When
such fields are accessed from a Java application via Jaybird and
character set of the connection does not match the character encoding of
the field, conversion errors might happen. Therefore it is recommended
to convert such fields in the application using the appropriate
encoding.

Heuristic transaction completion support
----------------------------------------

Current JCA implementation does not support `XAResource.forget(Xid)`. It
might be important in cases where a distributed transaction - that was at
some time in-limbo - was either committed or rolled back by the database
administrator. Such transactions appear to Jaybird as successfully
completed, however XA specification requires resource manager to
"remember" such transaction until the `XAResource.forget(Xid)` is called.

Compatibility with `com.sun.rowset.*`
-------------------------------------

The reference implementation of `javax.sql.rowset` included with Java in
package `com.sun.rowset` does not correctly look up columns by name as
it ignores column aliases and only allows look up by the original column
name[^5] (this specifically applies to `com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl`).

[^5]: See [JDBC-162](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/JDBC-162) and
      <http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7046875> for details

We advise you to either only access columns by their index or use an
implementation which correctly uses the column label for column lookup
(which is either the alias or the original column name if no alias was
defined).

Jaybird 2.2.1 introduced the connection property `columnLabelForName`
for backwards compatible behavior of `ResultSetMetaData#getColumnName(int)`.
Set property to `true` for backwards compatible behavior (`getColumnName()`
returns the column label); don't set the property or set it to `false` for
JDBC-compliant behavior (recommended).

Support for Firebird 3 `BOOLEAN` type
-------------------------------------

Jaybird 2.2.4 introduces support for the Firebird 3 `BOOLEAN` type. A
boolean field can also be set with all numeric setters and the string
setter (as implied by JDBC 4.1 appendix B).

For numeric types, currently only `0` will set to `false` and all other
values will set to `true`. This is something that might change in the
future. Only `0` for `false` and `1` for `true` are guaranteed, in the
future we might decide to throw a conversion exception for other values!

For string types we currently set `true` for `"true"`, `"T"`, `"Y"` and
`"1"` (case insensitive, ignoring whitespace), all other values will set
`false`; this is for compatibility with the current `getBoolean`
behaviour of `FBStringField`. This is something that might change in the
future. Only `"true"` and `"1"` for `true` and `"false"` and `"0"` for
`false` are guaranteed (case insensitive, ignoring whitespace), in the
future we might decide to throw a conversion exception for other values!

When using string or numeric setters for a boolean field we **strongly
recommend** to only use the guaranteed values (`0`, `1`, `"0"`, `"1"`,
`"true"` and `"false"`). Better yet: use the boolean setter instead.

Connection pooling with Jaybird
===============================

As described in [Important changes to Datasources], the
`ConnectionPoolDataSource `implementations in `org.firebirdsql.pool`
contain some serious issues. The connection pool capability which
depends on these classes will be removed in Jaybird 3.0.

This change leaves only the `ConnectionPoolDataSource` implementations
in `org.firebirdsql.ds` (for use by application server connection
pools). There are no plans to reintroduce a new standalone connection
pooling capability. We probably will migrate some of the features like
statement pooling to the normal JDBC driver.

If you require standalone connection pooling, or use an application
server which has no built-in connectionpool, please consider using a
third-party connection pool like c3p0, DBCP or HikariCP.

Description of deprecated `org.firebirdsql.pool` classes
--------------------------------------------------------

> **WARNING: This section provides information on deprecated classes**
>
> See [Important changes to Datasources]

Connection pooling provides effective way to handle physical database
connections. It is believed that establishing new connection to the
database takes some noticeable amount or time and in order to speed things
up one has to reuse connections as much as possible. While this is true
for some software and for old versions of Firebird database engine,
establishing connection is hardly noticeable with Firebird 1.0.3 and
Firebird 1.5. So why is connection pooling needed?

There are few reasons for this. Each good connection pool provides a
possibility to limit number of physical connections established with the
database server. This is an effective measure to localize connection
leaks. Any application cannot open more physical connections to the
database than allowed by connection pool. Good pools also provide some
hints where connection leak occurred. Another big advantage of
connection pool is that it becomes a central place where connections are
obtained, thus simplifying system configuration. However, main advantage
of good connection pool comes from the fact that in addition to
connection pooling, it can pool also prepared statement. Tests executed
using AS3AP benchmark suite show that prepared statement pooling might
increase speed of the application by 100% keeping source code clean and
understandable.

Usage scenario
--------------

When some statement is used more than one time, it makes sense to use
prepared statement. It will be compiled by the server only once, but
reused many times. It provides significant speedup when some statement
is executed in a loop. But what if some prepared statement will be used
during lifetime of some object? Should we prepare it in object's
constructor and link object lifetime to JDBC connection lifetime or
should we prepare statement each time it is needed? All such cases make
handling of the prepared statements hard, they pollute application's
code with irrelevant details.

Connection and statement pooling remove such details from application's
code. How would the code in this case look like? Here's the example

~~~ {.java .numberLines}
Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();
try {
    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        “SELECT * FROM test_table WHERE id = ?”);
    try {
        ps.setInt(1, id);
        ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
        while (rs.next()) {
            // do something here
        }
    } finally {
        ps.close();
    }
} finally {
    connection.close();
}
~~~

Lines 1-16 show typical code when prepared statement pooling is used.
The application obtains a JDBC connection from the data source (instance of
`javax.sql.DataSource` interface), prepares some SQL statement as if it is
used for the first time, sets parameters, and executes the query. Lines 12
and 15 ensure that statement and connection will be released under any
circumstances. Where do we benefit from the statement pooling? The call to
prepare a statement in lines 3-4 is intercepted by the pool, which checks
if there's a free prepared statement for the specified SQL query. If no
such statement is found it prepares a new one. In line 12 the prepared
statement is not closed, but returned to the pool, where it waits for the
next call. Same happens to the connection object that is returned to the
pool in line 15.

Connection Pool Classes (deprecated)
------------------------------------

Jaybird connection pooling classes belong to the `org.firebirdsql.pool.*`
package. Description of some connection pool classes:

|Class                           |Description
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------
|`AbstractConnectionPool`        |Base class for all connection pools. Can be used for implementing custom pools, not necessarily for JDBC connections.
|`BasicAbstractConnectionPool`   |Subclass of `AbstractConnectionPool`, implements `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` interface. Also provides some basic properties (minimum and maximum number of connections, blocking and idle timeout, etc) and code to handle JNDI-related issues.
|`DriverConnectionPoolDataSource`|Implementation of `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` for arbitrary JDBC drivers, uses `java.sql.DriverManager` to obtain connections, can be used as JNDI object factory.
|`FBConnectionPoolDataSource`    |Jaybird specific implementation of `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` and `javax.sql.XADataSource` interfaces, can be used as JNDI object factory.
|`FBSimpleDataSource`            |Implementation of `javax.sql.DataSource` interface, no connection and statement pooling is available, connections are physically opened in `getConnection()` method and physically closed in their `close()` method.
|`FBWrappingDataSource`          |Implementation of `javax.sql.DataSource` interface that uses `FBConnectionPoolDataSource` to allocate connections. This class defines some additional properties that affect allocated connections. Can be used as JNDI object factory.
|`SimpleDataSource`              |Implementation of `javax.sql.DataSource` interface that uses `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` to allocate physical connections.

`org.firebirdsql.pool.FBConnectionPoolDataSource` (deprecated)
--------------------------------------------------------------

This class is a corner stone of connection and statement pooling in
Jaybird. It can be instantiated within the application as well as it can
be made accessible to other applications via JNDI. Class implements both
`java.io.Serializable` and `javax.naming.Referenceable` interfaces, which
allows using it in a wide range of web and application servers.

Class implements both `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` and
`javax.sql.XADataSource` interfaces. Pooled connections returned by this
class implement `javax.sql.PooledConnection` and `javax.sql.XAConnection`
interfaces and can participate in distributed JTA transactions.

Class provides following configuration properties:

### Standard JDBC Properties

This group contains properties defined in the JDBC specification and
should be standard to all connection pools.

|Property           |Getter|Setter|Description
|-------------------|:----:|:----:|--------------------------------------------
|`maxIdleTime`      |+     |+     |Maximum time in milliseconds after which idle connection in the pool is closed.
|`maxPoolSize`      |+     |+     |Maximum number of open physical connections.
|`minPoolSize`      |+     |+     |Minimum number of open physical connections. If value is greater than 0, corresponding number of connections will be opened when first connection is obtained.
|`maxStatements`    |+     |+     |Maximum size of prepared statement pool. If 0, statement pooling is switched off. When application requests more statements than can be kept in pool, Jaybird will allow creating that statements, however closing them would not return them back to the pool, but rather immediately release the resources.

### Pool Properties

This group of properties are specific to the Jaybird implementation of
the connection pooling classes.

|Property           |Getter|Setter|Description
|-------------------|:----:|:----:|--------------------------------------------
|`blockingTimeout`  |+     |+     |Maximum time in milliseconds during which application can be blocked waiting for a connection from the pool. If no free connection can be obtained, exception is thrown.
|`retryInterval`    |+     |+     |Period in which pool will try to obtain new connection while blocking the application.
|`pooling`          |+     |+     |Allows to switch connection pooling off.
|`statementPooling` |+     |+     |Allows to switch statement pooling off.
|`pingStatement`    |+     |+     |Statement that will be used to "ping" JDBC connection, in other words, to check if it is still alive. This statement must always succeed.
|`pingInterval`     |+     |+     |Time during which connection is believed to be valid in any case. Pool "pings" connection before giving it to the application only if more than specified amount of time passed since last "ping".

### Runtime Pool Properties

This group contains read-only properties that provide information about
the state of the pool.

|Property           |Getter|Setter|Description
|-------------------|:----:|:----:|--------------------------------------------
|`freeSize`         |+     |-     |Tells how many free connections are in the pool. Value is between 0 and `totalSize`.
|`workingSize`      |+     |-     |Tells how many connections were taken from the pool and are currently used in the application.
|`totalSize`        |+     |-     |Total size of open connection. At the pool creation – 0, after obtaining first connection – between `minPoolSize` and `maxPoolSize`.
|`connectionCount`  |+     |-     |(**Deprecated**). Same as `freeSize`.

`org.firebirdsql.pool.FBWrappingDataSource`
-------------------------------------------

This class is a wrapper for `FBConnectionPoolDataSource` converting
the interface from `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` to
`javax.sql.DataSource`. It defines same properties as
`FBConnectionPoolDataSource` does.

Runtime object allocation and deallocation hints
------------------------------------------------

The Ppool implementation shipped with Jaybird can provide hints for the
application where the connection was obtained from the pool, when it was
released back to the pool, when the statement was prepared. Such
information is written into the log when appropriate system properties
are set to `true`.

### List of properties

|Property name         |Description
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
|`FBLog4j`             |Enables logging inside driver. This is the essential property, if it is not present or set to `false`, no debug information is available.\
                        When it is set to `true`, pool automatically prints the following information:\
						-   When physical connection is added to the pool – `DEBUG`\
                        -   When a maximum pool capacity is reached – `DEBUG`\
                        -   When connection is obtained from pool – `DEBUG`\
                        -   When connection is released back to pool – `DEBUG`\
                        -   Whether pool supports open statements across transaction boundaries – `INFO`
|`FBPoolShowTrace`     |Enables logging of the thread stack trace when debugging is enabled and:\
                        -   Connection is allocated from the pool – `DEBUG`\
                        -   Thread is blocked while waiting for a free connection – `WARN`\
|`FBPoolDebugStmtCache`|When statement caching is used and debugging is enabled, following information is logged:\
                        -   When a statement is prepared – `INFO`\
                        -   When statement cache is cleaned – `INFO`\
                        -   When statement is obtained from or returned back to pool – `INFO`
