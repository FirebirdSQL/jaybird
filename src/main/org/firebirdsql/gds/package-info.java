/**
 * Low-level APIs for accessing a Firebird database server.
 * <p>
 * This package contains classes defining the Firebird API for Java language that applications can use to access
 * databases directly without JDBC interfaces. This is probably most efficient way to access the database, but also it
 * is the most complicated one and requires deep knowledge of the Firebird API. For better understanding please refer
 * to the "InterBase 6 API Guide" published by Borland and released together with the open-sourcing the InterBase code,
 * a predecessor of Firebird.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Please refer to the documentation in the javadoc comments as well as to the source code for more information.
