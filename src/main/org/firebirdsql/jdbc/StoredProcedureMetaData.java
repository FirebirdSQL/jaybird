     * procedure will be recorded and the ambiguity removed. We try to replicate the Firebird rules for resolving
     * ambiguity, but it is possible that we diverge. By recording the procedure we resolved, we ensure the executed
     * stored procedure is at least consistent with our decision, and ensure that changes to the search path do not

     * times over the lifetime of the statement object, while JDBC requires stable schema resolution after
