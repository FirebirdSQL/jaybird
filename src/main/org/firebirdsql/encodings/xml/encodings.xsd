                            If the javaName is illegal according to the rules established in java.nio.charset.Charset, this encoding will be ignored.

                            Fully qualified name of a class implementing org.firebirdsql.encodings.EncodingDefinition to provide custom encoding/decoding. This class must
                            provide a no-arg constructor. If this attribute is not specified, then Jaybird will use one of its own EncodingDefinition implementations based on
                            the information provided. If both javaName and the encodingImplementation are not specified, then this element is purely informational.
                            In that case Jaybird will not support this character set (with the explicit exception of NONE and OCTETS).

                            If set to true, this encoding will only be mapped by its Firebird encoding name. This is for example used to map Firebird encoding
                            UNICODE-FSS to Java encoding UTF-8, but in reverse Java encoding UTF-8 is mapped to Firebird encoding UTF8. Defaults to false.
